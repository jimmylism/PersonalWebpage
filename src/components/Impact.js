                <p>My <b>drive</b> is creating an <b>impact</b> in the community around me. I am constantly looking for opportunities to give back to the community and creating a difference for those who are less fortunate. Some of the ways that I try to make an impact are:</p>
                <li>Joining <a href="https://aaaiub.com/"><b>Asian American Association</b></a> as the <b>marketing director</b> to help foster a sense of Asian community in a state where Asian-Americans are traditionally under-represented</li>
                <li>Offering <b>mentorship</b> to those looking to computer science in their academics and careers, focusing on underrepresented groups in tech as well as those with non-traditional backgrounds.</li>
                <li>Leading a team of four developers as a <b>program manager</b> for <a href="https://iustudentgovernment.indiana.edu/"><b>Indiana University Student Government</b></a> to better assist the student body</li>
